Hi! I'm Jason Cheng, a 2nd year Computer Engineering student at McMaster University.

I'm interested in machine learning and using software to improve 
efficiency at performing all sorts of tasks. Feel free to reach out!

Currently team member @ Google Developer Student Group at McMaster, working on LLM interpretability.
